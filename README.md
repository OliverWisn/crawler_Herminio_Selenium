# Crawler to scrap the web page https://www.flashscore.com/ .

## Motivation:
Herminio Henriques on Stack Overflow started the topic: "Beautifulsoup4 
find_all not getting the results I need". I decided to answer this 
question with the help of this crawler (code).

## Requirements: 
python 3.9 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
- I made this script so that the master branch has always the functioning 
  code. 
- To run the script you must run the file "crawler_selenium.py". 

## Script Summary:
In the future.

## Version:
In the future.
